# title: Q&A

## JAVA

### \*. What are the key principles of object-oriented programming, and could you provide an example of each?

### \*. Is it possible for the 'public static void main' method to work without being named 'main'? If not, why?

### \*. Can we run a class in Java 1.9, which was compiled in Java 1.8?

### \*. Can a single Java class contain multiple 'main' methods? If so, how does the program determine which one to execute?

### \*. Explain the differences between encapsulation and abstraction in Java with examples.

### \*. Differentiate between method overloading and method overriding, providing examples.

### \*. Explain Inheritance vs Composition

### \*. What are access modifiers in Java, and which ones are inherited by subclasses?

### \*. Default vs protected access specifiers.

### \*. Explain the concept of a static method in Java and its significance.

### \*. Can you override a private or static method in Java?

### \*. Could you elaborate on the usage of 'this' and 'super' keywords in Java?

### \*. Discuss the immutability of Strings in Java and the reasons behind it.

### \*. Implement your own immutable class in Java.

### \*. Compare and contrast shallow cloning and deep cloning in Java, providing examples.

### \*. What happens when you override both the 'equals' and 'hashCode' methods in Java? What if 'hashCode' returns the same value while 'equals' returns false?

### \*. Explore the features introduced in Java 8 such as Function Interface, Method Reference, Streams, and Collections.

### \*. How is the diamond problem resolved in interfaces after Java 8?

### \*. Differentiate between abstract classes and interfaces in Java, discussing their respective use cases.

### \*. What is multithreading in Java, and how can you implement it using threads (Start with how thread is created)?

### \*. Explain the concepts of compile-time and runtime exceptions in Java, with examples.

### \*. What are some best practices for handling exceptions in Java programs?

### \*. Is a catch block mandatory when handling exceptions in Java? Explain.

### \*. What is nested try-catch in Java, and when might you use it (Describe all possibilities)?

### \*. What will happen if you put the return statement or System.exit() on the try or catch block? Will finally block execute?

### \*. If a method throws NullPointerException in the superclass, can we override it with a method that throws RuntimeException? - Is it possible to load a class by two ClassLoader?

### \*. Discuss the significance of the 'volatile' keyword in Java and its impact on multithreading.

### \*. Explain serialization in Java and its importance in data persistence.

### \*. What happens if your Serializable class contains a member which is not serializable? How do you fix it?

### \*. What is a Singleton class, and how do you implement it in Java? What problem does it solve?

### \*. What is double check locking in singletons? - Are enums Singleton in Java?

### \*. Could you elaborate on FutureTask and Callable interfaces in Java, and how they relate to concurrency?

### \*. Why do we use readResolve in singletons? - Why wait(), notify(), and notifyAll() methods have to be called from a synchronized method or block?

### \*. Why are wait, notify, and notifyAll in the Object class?

### \*. Differentiate between concurrency and parallelism in Java.

### \*. Provide examples of IllegalStateException and NoSuchElementException in Java, and when they might occur.

### \*. How would you implement the Producer-Consumer pattern in Java using both wait/notify and BlockingQueue?

### \*. Why can constructors be created in abstract classes but not initialized? Explain the reasoning behind this.

### \*. How can you create custom exceptions in Java? Provide a brief overview of the process.

### \*. Explain the differences between ClassNotFoundException and NoClassDefFoundError exceptions in Java.

### \*. {Concurrency, Parallelism, Threads (Multithreading) (java)}, Processes, Async, and Sync?

### \*. How does hashing work in Java HashMap? Provide an overview of the process.

### \*. Compare and contrast ArrayList with LinkedList in Java, highlighting their differences.

### \*. Discuss the distinctions between ArrayList and HashMap in Java.

### \*. What are the differences between TreeSet and HashSet in Java, and when would you use each?

### \*. Compare Vector and ArrayList in Java, considering their features and use cases.
